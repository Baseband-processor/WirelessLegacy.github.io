<p>Honestly, I never liked Python, but I must admit that its community is extremely well organized (even better than the Perl community under almost all points of view).</p>
<p>Python nowadays is a top language for the CyberSecurity (and it is used as &quot;top language&quot; also in more fields: some &quot;distant&quot; examples are artificial intelligence and finance), but nothing is written in Perl, remembering that Perl has the same potentialities of every normal programming language, why don&#39;t write some usefull security tool in Perl? is fast and easy to write, exists few Perl-libraries on security, but XS is still a fast and affidable way for starting the development of a bigger project, this is one example:</p>
<p>Lorcon2, as you may know, is a really interesting library, which permits to test the security of a network, why don&#39;t start from it?</p>
