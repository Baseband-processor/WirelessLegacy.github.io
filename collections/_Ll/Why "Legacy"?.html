alias: Why not stop to Lorcon2?
---

<p>The first name was Air::Lorcon2 because the library was centered only on Lorcon2 API, now things have changed, drastically. Perl hasn&#39;t an official library for wireless security nor it has a working framework for it, the things must change, now.</p>
<p>&quot;Legacy&quot; is the union of Lorcon2, reaver, aircrack-ng (and its modules) and other cryptanalytic tools for CCMP/TKIP protocol.</p>
